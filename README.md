# instagramAPI
This project includes a OAuth token access to my developer instagram account and will display photos I posted on my instragam respectively to my location.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node-JS

In this project we have a button tag the sends the user to their instagram account. The request is made for the user to give the client access to their photo gallery. This authorization allows the application of the client to display photos nearby based on the location tag of the photo.

# Optimizations
Still need styling and also include messages or comments from friends so the user can see based on their location.

# Lesson Learned:
Will come later when changes are made.
